Mutater's Clip Editor
  Created by Vincent G, aka Mutater


Python3 and FFMPEG are required to use this script.
To install required modules either:
 - Run setup.bat
 - Run "python -m pip install -r requirements.txt" without quotes in this directory in cmd.

Make sure to configure "config.txt" and use the appropriate video codec.
If the script freezes after inputting the output directory, the wrong video codec was used.


To download Python3:
 - Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
 - Select the most recent python 3.x version.
 - Run through the installer, making sure to add Python to Path.

To download FFMPEG:
 - Open https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z
 - Open the archive with 7zip or another program.
 - Navigate to the "bin" directory.
 - Extract "ffmpeg.exe" to the same directory as the clip editor.
